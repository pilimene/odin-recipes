    <p><h2><strong>Description</strong></p></h2>
    <p>Pasta fazool is classic Italian American comfort food. This recipe works with any sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together.</p>
   


    <p><h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></p></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>12 ounces sweet bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>
   
    
    <p><h2><strong>Directions</strong></p></h2>

        <li><p><em>Step 1</em></p></li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
        <li><p><em>Step 2</em></p></li>
        Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3 cups broth; increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth if needed.
        <li><p><em>Step 3</em></p></li>
        Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
